- Friendly and enemy AI:
	- Different steering behaviours, that can be combined (flocking, wander, obstacle avoidance, etc.).
	- State machines controlling unit behaviours.
- Spatial partitioning is utilized to improve performance.
- Terrain map avaliable to the player, with the abiltity to draw on it.
- Different design patterns are utilized to keep the code maintainable.

### **Multi-User Dungeon game prototype**
<img src="https://github.com/weywocketer/weywocketer/blob/master/Images/mud.png" width=30%>

Prototype of a platform for the text-based multiplayer game, created using Python.
- Clients can interact with the world by sending player commands to the server.
- In fixed intervals server sends updated world information to clinets.
- Communication based on TCP protocol â€” due to relatively wide server fixed intervals, higher packet delays are not a big concern.
- Multithreading is used to handle multiple server connections.
- Clients use text-based user interface (TUI) created with npyscreen library.
