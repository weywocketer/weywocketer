- Distance and melee combat.
- Soldiers in the unit try to maintain the line formation by filling into the empty spots.
- Unit deployment phase before the battle starts.
- Morale and stamina system.

- 3 scenarios ready to play.
- Simple, random decision based AI.

### Multi-User Dungeon game prototype
<img src="https://github.com/weywocketer/weywocketer/blob/master/Images/mud.png" width=30%>

Prototype of a platform for text-based multiplayer game, created using Python.
- Clients can interact with the world by sending player commands to the server.
- In fixed intervals server sends updated world information to clinets.
- Communication based on TCP protocol â€” due to relatively wide server fixed intervals, higher packet delays are not a big concern.
- Multithreading is used to handle multiple server connections.
- Clients use text-based user interface (TUI) created with npyscreen library.
